### :smile: Usage

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap. Supports all default HTML Button properties. See Material Design Button for UI/UX information.

Button variants could be imported separately.

```js
import { OutlinedButton, ContainedButton, TextButton } from 'Button';
```
